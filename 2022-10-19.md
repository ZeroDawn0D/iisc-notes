Induction;
Claim $P(n)$ is true.
Proof: P(0) is true (show this) // 0 \in B
B = $\{k \in \mathbb{N}$: P(k) is true}
if $k \in B$ then $k+1 \in B$
Suppose $P(k)$ is true, show that $P(k+1)$ is true
By Principle of Mathematical Induction, P(n) is true $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$

##### The ZFC Axioms

Reason: Not any collection can be called a set.

A. Basic. Every object is a set.

B. Extension. Two sets A,B are equal if they have exactly the same elements. In other words, $A=B$ if and only if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.

C. Existence. There is a set with no elements called the empty set, denoted by $\emptyset$

D. Specification. Let A be a set. Let P(a) denote a property that applies to every element in A, i.e., for each a $\in$ A, either P(a) is true or it is false. Then there exists a subset $B = \{a \in A: P(a)$ is true}

E. Pairing. Given two sets, A,B there exists a set which contains precisely A and B as elements. Which we denote by {A,B}. 

(In particular, this also gives {A}, a set with one element A.)

F. Unions. GIven a set F of sets there exists a new set, called the  union of the sets in F, denoted by 
$$\bigcup_{A \in F}A$$
precisely, the element of the elements of F
$$a \in \bigcup_{A \in F} A \Leftrightarrow a \in F \space for\space some \space A \in F$$
Consequence: Intersection, set difference oof a non empty set of sets

G. Power set. Given a  set A, there is a set called the power set of A, denoted by P(A), whose elements are precisely all the subsets of A.
E.g.
A = {1, {3}}
P(A) = $\emptyset, {1}, {{3}}, {1, {3}}$
Consequence: G allows us to define ordered pairs as sets, i.e. Given $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, (a,b) has meaning in ZFC.
We can define AxB =
