#### Definition 1.2: Set
A set is a well-defined collection of (mathematical) objects called the elements of the set. To say that a is an element of the set A, we write $a \in A$. Otherwise we say that $a \notin A$ 
Given 2 sets A and B, we say that
* $A \subseteq B$: A is a subset of B. Every Element in A is an element in B
* $A \not\subseteq B$: A is not a subset of B. There exists an element in A that is not in B
* $A \subset B$: A is a proper subset of B, $A \subseteq B$ but $\exists \space y \in B \space$ such that $\space y \notin A$   

(Note: Purvi uses a different notation for $\subset$ which is not in MathJax, refer to notes)
