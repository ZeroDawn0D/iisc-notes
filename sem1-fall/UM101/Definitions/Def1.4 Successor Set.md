#### Definition 1.4 Successor Set
Given a set A, its successor is the set $A^+ = A \cup \{A\}$

A set A is said to be inductive if $\phi \in A$ and $\forall a \in A$, we have that $a^+ \in A$

Infinity: There is an inductive set

###### Lemma 1.5 
Let F be a non-empty set of inductive sets, then $$\bigcap_{A \in F}A$$ is inductive

###### Theorem 1.6
There is exists a unique, minimal, inductive set $\omega$, ie. for every inductive set S, $\omega \subseteq S$

###### Theorem 1.7
The $\omega$ in (1.6) is a Peano set with successor function $S:a \mapsto a^+$
