#### Definition 1.3a Relation
Given set $A,B$, a relation R from A to B is a subset of AxB, we say that $aRb \iff (a,b) \in R \space\forall\space a \in A, b \in B$

#### Definition 1.3b Domain
Domain of R is the set $$dom(R) = \{a \in A: (a,b) \in R \space for \space some \space b \in B\}$$
#### Definition 1.3c Range
Range of R is the set $$ran(R) = \{b \in B: (a,b) \in R \space for \space some \space a \in A\}$$
#### Definition 1.3d Function
R is called a function from A to B, denoted by $R: A \rightarrow B$ iff
* dom(R) = A
* $\forall a \in A$ there is atmost one $b \in B$ st. $(a,b) \in R$

Ex. Write definitions for 1-1(injective) and onto(surjective) functions
Remark: Bijective function from A to B is a 1-1 function from A onto B
