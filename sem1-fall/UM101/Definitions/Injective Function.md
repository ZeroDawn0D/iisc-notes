(also known as injection or one-to-one function)

An injective function is a function f that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements. That is, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$. Equivalently $x_1 \neq x_2$ implies $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$ in the equivalent contrapositive statement.
