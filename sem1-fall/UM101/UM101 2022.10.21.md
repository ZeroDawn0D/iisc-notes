#### Definition 1.3 [[Def1.3 Relation|Relation]]

H: Regularity
I: Replacement
J: Choice
K: Infinity

#### Definition 1.4 [[Def1.4 Successor Set|Successor Set]]
Infinity: There is an inductive set

###### Lemma 1.5 
Let F be a non-empty set of inductive sets, then $$\bigcap_{A \in F}A$$ is inductive

###### Theorem 1.6
There is exists a unique, minimal, inductive set $\omega$, ie. for every inductive set S, $\omega \subseteq S$

###### Theorem 1.7
The $\omega$ in (1.6) is a Peano set with successor function $S:a \mapsto a^+$

###### Theorem 1.8 (The Recursive Principle)
Let A be a set and $f: A \mapsto A$ be a function. Let a \in A. Then there exists a unique function $F: \omega \mapsto A$ st. 
* $F(\phi) = a$
* $F(b^+) = f(F(b)), b \in \omega$

#### Natural numbers
We will identify $\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3, ...\}$  with $\omega$ as follows
$0:=\phi$
$1 := 0^+ = \phi \cup \{\phi\} = \{\phi\} = \{0\}$
$2:=1^+ = \{0,1\} = \{\phi,\{\phi\}\}$
$3 := 2^+ = \{0,1,2\}$
