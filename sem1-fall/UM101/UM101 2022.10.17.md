$\mathbb{R} \leftarrow$ Real

Note: $\mathbb{N}$ includes 0

#### Definition 1.1: [[Def1.1 Peano Set|Peano Set]]
A set A is said to be a Peano Set if it satifies the following axioms:
1. There is a distinguished element; which we call 0 in A
2. There exists a function S from A to A called the successor function
3. $S(a) \neq 0, \forall \space a \in A$
4. If $S(a) = S(b)$, then $a=b \space \forall a,b \in A$ ([[Injective Function|one-to-one, injective]])
5. (Principle of mathematical induction). Suppose B is a subset of A such that $0 \in B$, and $S(a) \in B, \forall \space a \in B$, then B=A

#### Example
Let A be a set such that 
1. A = {0,1,2,3,4}
2. S(0) = 1, S(1) = 2, S(2) = 3, S(3) = 4, S(4)  = 1
This is not a Peano set because of P4:  S(0) = S(4) but 0 $\neq$ 4

#### Example
Let A be a set such that
1. A = {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, ...}
2. S(x) = x + 1
This is not a Peano set because of P5
Let us assume B is a subset of A which contains 0. It also contains S(0) and S(S(0)) and so on
so, B = {0,1,2,3, ...}
But A $\neq$ B. This violates P5 

### The ZFC Axioms

#### Definition 1.2: [[Def1.2 Set|Set]]
A set is a well-defined collection of (mathematical) objects called the elements of the set. To say that a is an element of the set A, we write $a \in A$. Otherwise we say that $a \notin A$ 
Given 2 sets A and B, we say that
* $A \subseteq B$: A is a subset of B. Every Element in A is an element in B
* $A \not\subseteq B$: A is not a subset of B. There exists an element in A that is not in B
* $A \subset B$: A is a proper subset of B, $A \subseteq B$ but $\exists \space y \in B \space$ such that $\space y \notin A$   

(Note: Purvi uses a different notation for $\subset$ which is not in MathJax, refer to notes)
