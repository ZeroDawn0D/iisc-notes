#### Definition 1.13 Field
A field is a set F with operators  $+:F\times F\rightarrow F$ and $\bullet:FxF\rightarrow F$ such that:
* F1: + and . are commutative on F
* F2: + and . are associative on F
* F3: + and . satisfy distributivity on F
$a.(b+c) = a.b + a.c$
* F4: There exists 2 distinct elements called 0 (additive identity) and 1(multiplicative identity) st.
$x + 0 = x$
$x.1 = x$
$\forall x \in F$

* F5: $\forall x \in F, \exists y \in F$ st.
$x+y=0$

* F6: $\forall x \in F - {0},\exists x \in F$ st.
$x.z = 1$

Remark: We are tempted to call y in F5 "-x" and z in F6 "1/x" but why are y and z unique?

###### Theorem A1.1 and A1.7: 
We will call y as  -x and z as 1/x
and
$a-b:= a+(-b)$
$a/b:= a.(1/b), b \neq 0$

###### Theorem 1.14 (A1.6)
(A1.1 to A1.7 are exercise)
(F,+,.) is a field 
$\forall x \in F$
$x.0 = 0.x = 0$
Proof:
By F1, the first equality holds.
By F4, 1+0 = 1
By F3, x.(1+0) = x.1 = x
By F3, x.1 + x.0 = x
By F4, x+x.0=x
By F4, $\exists y \in F$ st x+y=0
(x+x.0) + (y) = x+y=0
By F1 and F2
x+y + x.0 = 0
so 0 + x.0 = 0
so x.0 = 0 (by F1 and F3)

#### Definition 1.15: Ordererd Set
A set A with a relation < is called an ordered set if
* O1: For every x,y in A, exactly one of the three following statements hold:
$x=y, x<y, y>x$

* O2: If x< y and y < z, then x < z forall x,y,z in A (transitive)

$x<y$: "x is less than y"
$x<=y := x< y$ or $x=y$: "x is less than or equal to y"

#### Definition 1.16: Ordered Field
An ordered field is a set that admits 2 operators + and . and relations < so that $(F,+,\bullet)$ is a field and (F,<) is an ordered set and
* O3: For x,y,z in F, if x<y then x+z < y+z
* O4: for x,y in F, if 0< x and 0< y, then 0<x.y

O1-O4 are A1.16 to A1.19

###### Theorem 1.17: 0<1 (A1.21)
$(F,+,\bullet,<)$ is an ordered field

we will use
(-a).b = -(a.b)
and
(-a).(-b) = a.b

Proof 

from F4 $0 \neq 1$
By O1: 0<1 or 1<0
if 0<1 we are done

suppose 1<0
then 1+(-1) < 0 + (-1) by O3
0 < -1 (F1 and F4)
0 <(-1)(-1) O4
so 0<1
contradiction (O1)

So 0<1 is the only possibility
