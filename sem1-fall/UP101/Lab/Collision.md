## Pre-experiment

On measuring the weight of the kart we get $m = 265g = 0.265kg$

We calculate change in momentum in the following way $$\Delta p = m(v_1 + v_2)$$
(as $v_1$ and $v_2$ have opposite directions)

We calculate the impulse J by measuring the area under the Force vs time graph.

We calculate % difference as follows $$\% diff. = \frac{J-\Delta p}{\Delta p} \times 100$$

We calculate Yank in the following way: $$yank = \frac{dF}{dt}$$
Where F is the Force in newtons and t is the time in seconds

We have 4 bumpers (magnet, spring, rubber, clay)

We will plot the Force vs Time graph for each of the four bumpers 
We will also plot the Yank vs Time graph for each of the four bumpers.
We calculate the spring constant k by using the curve fitting technique

## Experiment

### Spring Bumper
(insert table as given in the file)

Initial velocity: 0.83 m/s
Final velocity: 0.74 m/s
del p = m(v1+v2) = 00.265(0.83+0.74) = 0.416
Impulse from graph: 0.43
pd = 3.36%


We apply curve fitting on the F vs t graph obtained from the spring bumper
### Magnet Bumper

Initial velocity: 0.76 m/s
Final velocity: 0.71m/s

del p = m(v1+v2) = 00.265(0.76+ 0.71) = 0.389
Impulse from graph: 0.39
pd = 0.257%

### Rubber Bumper
Initial velocity: 0.88 m/s
Final velocity: 0.36m/s

del p = m(v1+v2) = 00.265(0.88+ 0.36) = 0.328
Impulse from graph: 0.34
pd = 3.65%

### Clay Bumper
Initial velocity: 0.66 m/s
Final velocity: 0.12m/s

del p = m(v1+v2) = 00.265(0.66+ 0.12) = 0.199
Impulse from graph: 0.21
pd = 5.5%

## Analysis

Q1 Is the Impulse momentum theorem verified in the experiment? Explain why/why not

The Impulse Momentum theorem is the following: $$J = \Delta p = \int F dt$$
We calculated the area under the F vs t graph ($\int Fdt$) and the momentum. We observed that the values are approximately equal, with all percentage differences within 6%. 

Q2 Comment on the F vs t graphs that you obtained. (Here you are supposed to perform a comparative study of the graph)

Spring Bumper
The application of force begins as soon as the spring comes into the cart and continues as the spring is compressed and then decompressed again. Because of this, it has the second highest time period among all bumpers. The spring then performs damped harmonic oscillations over this time period. Because of this, we use the sin wave formula to fit the curve.

Magnet Bumper
Magnetic Force is non-contact in nature, hence the application of repulsive force on the cart begins earlier than all the other bumpers. Experimentally, it was observed that the cart was repulsed before there was any contact between it and the bumper. The lack of irregularities near the peak of the graph support this observation.

Rubber Bumper
Among all the bumpers used, Force reaches its highest peak here. Rubber is a very elastic material and does not compress easily, this makes the collision extremely abrupt, as shown by the sharp tangents in the F vs t graph.

Clay Bumper
Right after the initial collision, the force momentarily becomes negative. Clay is sticky and that is why the bumper also experiences a pull as the cart starts to move in the opposite direction.



Q3 What are the other ways to determine a better value spring constant apaer from what has been demonstrated  in the video

On applying a force F on a spring and moving it through displacement x, the Spring constant k is given from the equation $$F = kx$$ $$k = F/x$$
This is the slope of the F vs x graph. On measuring it, we would get the spring constant.

Q4 What is the theoretical expected ratio of the impulse from clay to the impulse from magnets? Does the theoretical prediction match the experimental observation?

In an elastic collision, both kinetic energy and momentum is conserved, while in an inelastic collision, only momentum is conserved.
The expected ratio is $$\frac{\text{Impulse from inelastic collision}}{\text{Impulse from elastic collision}} = \frac{1}{2}$$
We have the following data from the experiment
$\Delta p_{clay} =0.199$
$\Delta p_{magnet} =0.389$
$J_{clay} =0.21$
$J_{magnet} = 0.39$
$$\frac{\Delta p_{clay}}{\Delta p_{magnet}} = \frac{0.199}{0.389} = 0.511$$
$$\frac{J_{clay}}{J_{magnet}} = \frac{0.21}{0.39} = 0.538$$


The


Q5 Did you observe anything strange in any or all of the F vs t graphs that you plotted? If so, can you explain what you observed

1. There were minor forces being read by the system after and even before the actual collision took place. This could be because of small instability in the system as the cart moved.
2. The yank graph for clay was higher than that of rubber. This could be because the clay was no longer soft but had hardened completely.


Q6 In our daily life it is easier to break things with a quick blow. The force we apply is not constant. Why is it easy to break things this way as compared to the application of increasing forces.

We know that $$J = \Delta p = m\Delta v$$
When we apply force with a quick blow, $\Delta t$ is smaller. $\Delta v$ increases and therefore impulse is greater.
When force is applied over a long period of time, del t is larger and impulse is smaller.





Q7 The rate of change of force is called "yank" and the rate of change of acceleration is called "jerk". Which of the above cases have the highest yank and why?

The clay was observed to have the highest yank among the 4 bumpers. Theoretically, rubber is supposed to have the highest measured yank. While performing the experiment, clay was no longer soft but had hardened. So its yank subsequently increased. 

Q8 Can I use this apparatus to determine 'g', the acceleration due to gravity? Explain in brief.

We define Force due to friction as the following: $$F = \mu N$$
Where N is the normal force and $\mu$ is the coeffient of friction.

For this experiment $N = mg$, so we have $F = \mu mg$

We can calculate force due to friction from the initial and final velocity $$F = m \times\frac{v_2 - v_1}{t}$$
Equating the two equations, we get $$\mu g = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t}$$
We can calculate the acceleration due to gravity if the coefficient of friction of the colliding body is known
