#### [[Travelling Salesman Problem]]

Given a completely connected undirected [[graph]], find a [[Hamiltonian cycle]] of minimum weight.

Q: Given a completely connected undirected graph, find total number of distinct Hamiltonian cycles

Let us start from the vertex S. There are n-1 other vertices. If we were to write out the path, we get

S, [], [], [], (n-1 locations to put vertices), ..., S
There are $(n-1)!$ ways to put vertices. Since it is undirected, we need to remove all duplicate paths. The answer becomes $$\frac{(n-1)!}{2}$$
