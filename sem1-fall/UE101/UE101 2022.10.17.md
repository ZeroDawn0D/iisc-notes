#### [[Travelling Salesman Problem]]

Given a completely connected undirected [[graph]], find a [[Hamiltonian cycle]] of minimum weight.

Q: Given a completely connected undirected graph, find total number of distinct Hamiltonian cycles

Let us start from the vertex S. There are n-1 other vertices. If we were to write out the path, we get

S, [], [], [], (n-1 locations to put vertices), ..., S
There are $(n-1)!$ ways to put vertices. Since it is undirected, we need to remove all duplicate paths. The answer becomes $$\frac{(n-1)!}{2}$$
Write an algorithm to find the first hundred ramanujan numbers
```
COMMENT: We know the smallest ramanujan number is 1729, we will start from there
ASSUMPTION: There is no precision loss in cube root calculation

0: Start Execution of the program
1: Let C = 1
2: Let N = 1729
3: As long as C <= 100, keep iterating
3.1: Let LIM = Floor of the cube root of N
3.2: Let A,B,C,D be all initialised to -1
3.3: For i = 1 to LIM
3.3.1: Let j = N - i*i*i
3.3.2: if cube root of j is an integer then set A = i, B = j and exit loop 3.3
3.4: For i = 1 to LIM, i is not equal to A or B
3.4.1: Let j = N - i*i*i
3.4.2: if cube root of j is an integer then set C = i, D = j and exit loop 3.4
3.5: If none among A, B, C or D are set to -1, then print N and increment C by 1
3.6: increment N by 1
4: Stop execution of the program
