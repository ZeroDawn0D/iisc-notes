Russel's paradox shows that Naive Set Theory is flawed. It uses the
Comprehension principle:   "Given any property, there exists a set containing all objects that have that property". 

Consider the set defined by the property:
"The set of all sets which dont contain themselves"
$R = \{S:S\notin S\}$ 

Does R contain itself

Supposing it does:
Hypothesis: $R \in R$
So $R \in \{S: S\notin S \}$

Conclusion: $R \notin R$

A contradiction

Supposing it doesnt
Hypothesis: $R \notin R$
So $R \notin \{S: S\notin S \}$

Conclusion: $R \in R$

A contradiction

This constitutes a paradox

The most well known consistent axiomatic frame-work for set theory is ZFC set theory

ZFC is the Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice Included

##### ZFC 0: The Basic Axiom
Every Mathematical object is a set and for any two sets A and B we either have $A \in B$ or $A \notin B$

##### ZFC 1: The Axiom of Extension
For two sets A and B, $A=B$ if and only if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.

##### ZFC 2: The Axiom of Existence
We have at least one set, namely the empty set $\emptyset$.

###### ZFC 3: The Axiom of Specification
All subsets B of a given set A of the form $B = \{x \in A | \phi(x) \}$ exist, where $\phi(x)$ is some mathematical property, exist.

It implies for each set A the existence of an element (a set) x such that $x \notin A$. In other words, there is no set containing all sets of our mathematical universe.



###### ZFC 4: The Axiom of Foundation

###### ZFC 5: The Axiom of Pairing
For any given two sets A and B, there always exist the sets {A} and {A,B}.

##### ZFC 6: The Axiom of Unions
For a set of sets $\alpha$, the set 

$$\bigcup_{X \in \alpha}X := \{x | \exists X \in \alpha \space s.t \space x \in X \}$$
exists and is called the union of the sets of the set $\alpha$

###### ZFC 7: The Axiom of Powers
The set $$P(A) := \{X | X \subseteq A\}$$
exists. It is the set of all subsets of a given set A. It is called the power set of the set A.

##### ZFC 8: The Axiom of Substitution
Suppose for each element i of an index set I, the set $B_i$ exists. For example, we can think of an already existing family ${(A_i)}_{i \in I}$ and of a further set C. Then, by the axiom of unions, the set $A_i \cup C$ exists for each element. The axiom of substitution guarantees the existence of the family ${(B_i)}_{i \in I}$ with $$B_i := A_i \cup C \space\forall\space i \in I$$
##### ZFC 9: The Axiom of Choice
If ${(A_i)}_{i \in I}$ is a family of non-empty sets, then the direct product $\prod_{i \in I}A_i$ is also non-empty. Another way to express this axiom is to say that for each family ${(A_i)}_{i \in I}$ of non-emoty sets $A_i$ there exists a function $$ f: \{A_i | i \in I\} \rightarrow \bigcup_{i \in I}A_i$$
###### ZFC 10: The Axiom of Infinity
It is more or less identical to P5 of Peano. It guarantees the existence of an infinite set which is necessary to construct the natural numbers. It says:
There exists a set X with the following properties:
1. The empty set $\emptyset$ is contained in the set X.
2. If the set A is contained in the set X, then the set $A^+ := A \cup \{A\}$ is also contained in the set X.
$A^+$ is called the successor of the set A.
